# Design

## Colour Scheme

- The colour scheme i chose was from a pallette colour template. I had originally looked for a hero image for the site, i then based the colour pallette i picked to contrast well with the hero image chosen.

## Typograpy

- I researched font types that were used together on Music themed sites such as the one i created. 
- The fonts i chose were 'Josefin Sans' & 'Fira Mono', with sans-serif being used as a backup font, in case a browser wouldn't load the imported choices.

## Imagery 

-I chose to use the 'hero image' style of design for my project. I chose an eyecatching image, that immeadietly informs the viewer of what the site is about. It is also quite detailed and pleasing to look at while spending time on the site

## Testing

- I tested that the site works on all browsers, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
- I tested the site for its responsiveness at 3 different screen sizes, and across multiple device emulators in the devtools console
- I confirmed that all site links, both internal and external are working as they should
-I tested the form fields to make sure they all require the correct datatypes inputed, and prompt messages appear when expectations are not met, if you try to submit.      

## Bugs 

- When i was creating the readme file i could not get the image to load in my github repository, while it appeared in the readme preview in the code editor. I had an extra /project-portfolio-one/ layer added in, so while the directory appeared correct and the image appeared in the preview, the github file repository link was not the same as the direct link from ../project-portfolio-one/ --> through to the image file.    
- I changed this filepath and the image displayed correctly in my repository. 

## Validator Testing

### HTML
- No errors were returned upon validating my code through the official W3C validator
### CSS
- No errord were returned upon  validating my code through the official W3C Jigsaw validator
### ACCESSIBILITY 
- I achieved a high score for accessibility when generating a Lighthouse report for the site using devtools
